<!-- fill:file:summary -->
This module holds the static seed data for the headline metrics shown in the dashboard's KPI strip. It defines the `Kpi` interface and exports the `KPIS` array of four metric cards (agent runs, PRs reviewed, mean time to merge, and suite pass rate). `KpiStrip.tsx` is the sole consumer: it maps over `KPIS` to render each card, including its delta and a sparkline drawn from the `trend` series.

## Kpi

**Kind:** `interface`

```ts
export interface Kpi { ... }
```

<!-- fill:sym:Kpi:summary -->
`Kpi` is the interface describing a single headline metric: its identity (`id`), display text (`label`, `value`, `delta`, `hint`), whether the delta represents a good outcome (`positive`), and a `trend` series for the sparkline. The `positive` flag is decoupled from the delta's sign so that a falling metric — like mean time to merge — can still be marked as good. It is the element type of `KPIS` and is consumed only by `KpiStrip.tsx`.

### Shape

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| id | `string` | Stable unique slug for the metric (e.g. `agent-runs`), used as the React key. |
| label | `string` | Short metric name shown on the card (e.g. `Mean time to merge`). |
| value | `string` | Pre-formatted headline figure for the current period (e.g. `1,284`). |
| delta | `string` | Pre-formatted change versus the prior period, including sign (e.g. `+18%`, `-22%`). |
| positive | `boolean` | Whether the delta is a good outcome, independent of its sign (a falling time-to-merge is positive). |
| hint | `string` | One-line explanation of what the metric measures, shown as supporting text. |
| trend | `number[]` | Seven-point series (oldest first) rendered as the card's sparkline. |

## KPIS

**Kind:** `const`

```ts
const KPIS: Kpi[]
```

<!-- fill:sym:KPIS:summary -->
`KPIS` is the seed array of four `Kpi` records that fills the dashboard's KPI strip: agent runs over 7 days, PRs reviewed, mean time to merge, and suite pass rate. Each entry carries pre-formatted display strings plus a seven-point `trend` series for its sparkline. `KpiStrip.tsx` is the only consumer, mapping over the array to render one card per metric.
